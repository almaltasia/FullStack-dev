# Introduction to Python
## Variables
Variables are like a labelled box/Containers for storing and referencing data of different types.
to declare a Variable, is assign a value to an identifier woth the assignment (=) operator

anatomy variable in python, you just write tha name of the variable on the left, followed by the assignment operator, the value you want to assign the variable on the right.

```md
name = 'Alma'
age = 25
```
rules to naming variables in python:
1. can only start with a letter or an underscore (_), not a number
2. can only contain alpahumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscores(_).

2. use descriptive names for variables
3. avoid to using single-letter variable names
